# Algorithms and Data Structures Course

This repository contains my work for the Algorithms and Data Structures course. Throughout this course, I've learned about:

- Theoretical sorting algorithms
- Graph traversal and search techniques
- Union-find data structures
- Text algorithms and string processing

## Solutions

You can find here my solutions to various programming problems from [Szkopul](https://szkopul.edu.pl/), the platform used for this course.

Each solution is named according to its corresponding task for easy reference.
